# The contribution of p53 protein to longevity
Through its tumor suppression function, p53 is thought to play a role as a longevity regulator in various organisms. Recent research suggests that p53 may regulate aging and longevity. The aim of this project was to investigate the relationship between maximum lifespan and changes in p53 sequences. To this end, p53 protein sequences from long-lived organisms were compared with sequences from short-lived organisms. Selected sequences were subjected to protein structure prediction analysis, and attention was paid to their origin and evolutionary changes.

Tools:
- data bases: AnAge, NCBI, UniProt
- phylogenetic analysis: MEGA
- protein structure prediction: AlphaFold, SWISS-MODEL
